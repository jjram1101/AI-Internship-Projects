AI Internship Projects – CodeC Technologies

This repository contains two AI projects completed as part of a one-month internship with CodeC Technologies.

Project 1: Handwritten Digit Recognizer

Description:  
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built using TensorFlow to classify handwritten digits (0–9) from the MNIST dataset.

Technologies Used:
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib

Key Features:
- Preprocessed and normalized image data
- Achieved approximately 98% test accuracy
- Visual digit prediction using a trained model

Project 2: Spam Email Classifier

Description:  
An NLP-based model that classifies SMS messages as spam or not using a Naive Bayes classifier.

Technologies Used:
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- CountVectorizer

Key Features:
- Used a publicly available SMS spam dataset
- Achieved high classification accuracy
- Demonstrates basic text processing and spam filtering

How to Run:

For Handwritten Digit Recognizer:
python digit_recognizer.py

For Spam Email Classifier:
